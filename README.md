abstract = "Although a considerable amount of effort has been put in to show that fuzzy logic controllers have exceptional capabilities of dealing with uncertainty, there are still noteworthy concerns, e.g., the design of fuzzy logic controllers is an arduous task due to the lack of closed-form inputâ€“output relationships which is a limitation to interpretability of these controllers. The role of design parameters in fuzzy logic controllers, such as position, shape, and height of membership functions, is not straightforward. Motivated by the fact that the availability of an interpretable relationship from input to output will simplify the design procedure of fuzzy logic controllers, the main aims in this work are derive fuzzy mappings for both type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy logic controllers, analyse them, and eventually benefit from such a nonlinear mapping to design fuzzy logic controllers. Thereafter, simulation and real-time experimental results support the presented theoretical findings."
